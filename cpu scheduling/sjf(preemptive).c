/*
PSEUDOCODE (Simple Language):

1. Initialize time = 0, completed = 0
2. Repeat until all processes are completed:
   a. Among all arrived processes, find the one with the smallest remaining time.
   b. If no process has arrived yet, increment time by 1.
   c. Else, execute that process for 1 unit of time.
   d. Decrease the processâ€™s remaining time by 1.
   e. If remaining time becomes zero, mark process as completed,
      record completion, turnaround and waiting times.
3. After all processes are done, calculate average waiting and turnaround times.
